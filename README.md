# Realtime Terrain Generation

 A simple realtime-endless terrain generation for Unity.


## Introduction

Finding no simple solution to generate realtime and performant terrains in Unity, I created my own with caveman brain.

It's a pretty rudimentary way, which generates chunks of terrains, with props (no grass for now).

Terrains are shaped trough different layers of noises and have different LODs. 
A shader in the project allows to draw a different texture on steep areas.

There is multiple examples in the project, with differents uses/styles.

* I didn't tested it on mobile, but it might work pretty well.

Everything is fully customizable.
