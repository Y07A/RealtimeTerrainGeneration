# Realtime Terrain Generation

 A simple realtime-endless terrain generation for Unity.


## Introduction

Finding no simple solution to generate realtime and performant terrains in Unity, I created my own with my caveman brain.

It's a pretty rudimentary way, which generate chunks of terrains, with props (no grass for now).

Terrains are shaped trough different layers of noises, have different LODs.

Everything is fully customizable.
